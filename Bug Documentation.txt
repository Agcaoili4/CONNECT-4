1.) Main menu was having an infinite loop, was addressed quickly upon decoding - Jansen (done)
2.) Column choosing isnt working properly. Debugged it by having a test on the main class - Jansen (done)
3.) Player is working fine, but had some problems on the implementation of the board and printBoard - Jansen (done)
4.) Conditions need to be applied. So far the columns are working properly now and there should be a proper way to handle how the player
will win - Jansen
